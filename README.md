# Design-and-Implementation-of-Sophisticated-MarkDown-SMD-
This project aims to create a more advanced version of Markdown, termed Sophisticated MarkDown (SMD). While retaining the simplicity and core features of traditional Markdown, SMD introduces capabilities for natural extension through user-defined function calls. Drawing inspiration from Jinja templates, SMD also facilitates parameter passing, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability for content creators.

Key Features:

Core Markdown Formatting (e.g., bold, italic, hyperlinks, headers, lists)
Natural Extension Mechanisms
Parameterized Content Templates inspired by Jinja
Intuitive Syntax for Enhanced Content Management
