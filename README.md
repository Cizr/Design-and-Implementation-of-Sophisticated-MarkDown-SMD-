# Sophisticated MarkDown (SMD) - An Evolution of Markdown

## Introduction

Markdown (MD) is a straightforward formatting language designed for quickly styling text for online display. It offers simplified constructs for text formatting, such as bold, italic, hyperlinks, headings, lists, and more. While its base syntax is minimalistic, various flavors of Markdown exist. These flavors provide advanced functionalities but often lack standard support, necessitating extensions.

## Objective

This project introduces Sophisticated MarkDown (SMD), an enhanced version of Markdown. SMD retains the foundational features of classic Markdown but introduces a mechanism for users to naturally extend its capabilities through custom function calls. Drawing inspiration from the Jinja template language, SMD also integrates parameter passing, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability for content creation.

## Key Features

- **Fundamental Markdown Formatting**: Bold, italic, hyperlinks, headings, and lists.
- **User-Defined Extensions**: Integrate custom functionalities seamlessly.
- **Intuitive Syntax**: Designed for intuitive content management and creation.
